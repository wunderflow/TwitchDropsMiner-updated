        ## Before submitting an issue, look at the [project goals](https://github.com/Windows200000/TwitchDropsMiner-updated#project-goals)!
        If your issue is specific to one Operating System, consider whether it should be a bug report instead.
        Create only **one issue per feature**. This ensures no feature is forgotten.

        ### Bad Title:
        - 32-bit     | What do you actually want?
        - Status Icon in the tray     | What should it do?
        - Received error (working fine prior to reboot)
        - I am getting an error when trying to run

        ### Good Title:
        - Create a build for 32-bit Windows
        - Exclude impossible campaigns
        - TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
        - Drops not being claimed in the intended way, causing some to be missed and no notifications
